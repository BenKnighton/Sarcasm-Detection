# Sarcasm-Detection

Using news headlines, this machine learning model is able to differentiate between sarcastic comments/statements. I have not found this to be incredibly accurate like my other machine learning models, however it is the fastest by a considerable margin, which is necessary for my A.I assistants. I have found that if you want an accurate result, the transformers libraries by huggingface would suit you better. This model uses Keras.

### Run model.py to start the code. The neural net model is called: good model.h5
